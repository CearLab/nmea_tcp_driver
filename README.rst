nmea_TCP_driver
===============

This page is under construction

ROS driver to parse NMEA strings and publish standard ROS NavSat message types from TCP input. Does not require the GPSD daemon to be running. This is a modification of the nmea_navsat_driver project (http://ros.org/wiki/nmea_navsat_driver
) to work with GPS systems that transmit solutions through TCP, like the Reach RTK GPS. This project does not take ownership of the nmea_navsat_driver project as detailed in the license.
